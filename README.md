# testrepo
.net core testing on ubuntu running on a Docker container using Watchtower, a Docker cron container that updates containers when their images are updated.  In this case, my image is built in DockerHub via a webhook into this github repo. It will update when a push is detected.
I was also testing the app path and storing files locally via a volume, hence the text on the 'About' page.
